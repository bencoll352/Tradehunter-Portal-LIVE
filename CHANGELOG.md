## [1.0.0] - 2023-10-27

### Fixed
- Resolved critical server-side error ("Could not load goals") by correcting the Firebase Admin SDK initialization. The application now correctly connects to the local Firebase emulators during development.

### Added
- Conducted a comprehensive review and verification of all portal features: Dashboard, TradeHunter Pro (CRM), Estimator, Staff Training, Buildwise Intel, Smart Team, and Competitor Insight.
- Confirmed that all features are implemented correctly and align with the documentation.

### Changed
- Updated `src/lib/firebase-admin.ts` to intelligently detect the environment and connect to Firebase emulators locally or use service account credentials in production.
