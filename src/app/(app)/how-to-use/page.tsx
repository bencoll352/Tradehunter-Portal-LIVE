    value: "item-2",
    question: "How can I view trader data?",
    answer: "Once logged in, the dashboard will display a table of traders specific to your branch. You can sort columns by clicking on their headers, search by keywords, filter by category, and paginate through the data (50 traders per page). The dashboard also shows mini-stats like Live and Recently Active traders.",

    value: "item-3",
    question: "How do I add, edit, or delete a trader?",
    answer: "On the dashboard, use the 'Add New Trader' button. The form includes comprehensive fields like name, sales, status, contact info, notes, and call-back dates. To edit or delete, use the respective icons (pencil for edit, trash can for delete) in the 'Actions' column of the trader table. When adding manually, the system will warn you if a trader with the same phone number already exists.",

  },
   {
    value: "item-6",
    question: "How do I bulk upload traders using a CSV file?",
    answer: "Use the 'Bulk Add Traders' button on the dashboard. Upload a CSV file. The system uses flexible parsing: \n" +
            "‚Ä¢ **Headers are Key**: It primarily relies on matching header names (case-insensitive, space-trimmed), though a general column order is good practice (e.g., Name, Total Sales, Status, etc., up to 16 common fields). \n" +
            "‚Ä¢ **Mandatory 'Name'**: The 'Name' header and corresponding data for each trader are mandatory. \n" +
            "‚Ä¢ **Expected Headers (approximate)**: Name, Total Sales, Status, Last Activity, Description, Reviews, Rating, üåêWebsite, üìû Phone, Owner Name, Main Category, Categories, Workday Timing, Address, Link, Notes, Actions (Actions column data ignored). Some headers have alternative names (e.g., 'Owner Name' or 'Owner'). Refer to the dialog for specific examples and more details. \n" +
            "‚Ä¢ **Quoted Fields**: Fields containing commas (e.g., in Description, Address, Categories) MUST be enclosed in double quotes (e.g., \"Main St, Suite 100\"). \n" +
            "‚Ä¢ **Duplicate Handling**: Traders with phone numbers already existing in the database or duplicated within the CSV will be automatically skipped. A summary of additions and skips will be provided.",

  },
  {
    value: "item-4",
    question: "What is the Branch Booster?",
    answer: "The Branch Booster helps you analyse trader and customer data. Use Quick Actions for common analyses, type your questions (e.g., 'What is the total sales volume?', 'Who are the top traders?') into the query box. You can also upload a customer data file (e.g., .txt, .csv) for deeper, context-specific insights like upsell opportunities. The system uses advanced analytical models to provide answers based on the current data for your branch and any uploaded file.",
    icon: <Rocket className="h-5 w-5 text-primary mr-2" />
  },
  {
    value: "item-7",
    question: "What is the Sales & Strategy Accelerator? (Managers Only)",
    answer: "If you log in with a Manager ID (e.g., PURLEYMANAGER), you'll see the Sales & Strategy Accelerator below the Branch Booster. This tool connects to an external, specialised AI service for more in-depth strategic analysis. You can ask complex questions about market positioning, long-term sales strategies, competitive analysis relative to your branch's data, use strategic quick actions, upload supplemental documents (like market reports), and get AI-driven recommendations for optimising team performance and branch growth.",

    icon: <Briefcase className="h-5 w-5 text-primary mr-2" />
  },
  {
    value: "item-5",
    question: "Is my branch data secure and persistent?",
    answer: "Yes, the system is designed for data isolation. Each branch can only access its own trader data, authenticated by your Login ID. Manager logins see the same underlying branch data as their team. Trader data is persistently stored in Firebase Firestore, ensuring it's saved across sessions and centrally managed for your branch.",
