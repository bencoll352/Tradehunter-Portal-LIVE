    question: "How do I bulk upload traders using a CSV file?",
    answer: "Use the 'Bulk Add Traders' button on the dashboard. Upload a CSV file. The system uses flexible parsing: \n" +
            "‚Ä¢ **Headers are Key**: It primarily relies on matching header names (case-insensitive, space-trimmed), though a general column order is good practice (e.g., Name, Total Sales, Status, etc., up to 16 common fields). \n" +
            "‚Ä¢ **Mandatory 'Name'**: The 'Name' header and corresponding data for each trader are mandatory. \n" +
            "‚Ä¢ **Expected Headers (approximate)**: Name, Total Sales, Status, Last Activity, Description, Reviews, Rating, üåêWebsite, üìû Phone, Owner Name, Main Category, Categories, Workday Timing, Address, Link, Notes, Actions (Actions column data ignored). Some headers have alternative names (e.g., 'Owner Name' or 'Owner'). Refer to the dialogue for specific examples and more details. \n" +
            "‚Ä¢ **Quoted Fields**: Fields containing commas (e.g., in Description, Address, Categories) MUST be enclosed in double quotes (e.g., \"Main St, Suite 100\"). \n" +
            "‚Ä¢ **Duplicate Handling**: Traders with phone numbers already existing in the database or duplicated within the CSV will be automatically skipped. A summary of additions and skips will be provided.",

You can also upload a customer data file (e.g., .txt, .csv) for deeper, context-specific insights like upsell opportunities. The system uses advanced analytical models to provide answers based on the current data for your branch and any uploaded file.\n" +
            "When using it on the BuildWise Intel page, you can ask questions that bridge insights from the Intel portal with your trader data, e.g., 'How can I apply the market trends shown in BuildWise Intel to my top 5 traders?'",

    value: "item-7",
    question: "What is the Sales & Strategy Accelerator? (Managers Only)",

You can ask complex questions about market positioning, long-term sales strategies, competitive analysis relative to your branch's data, use strategic quick actions, upload supplemental documents (like market reports), and get AI-driven recommendations for optimising team performance and branch growth.",

    value: "item-5",
    question: "Is my branch data secure and persistent?",
    answer: "Yes, the system is designed for data isolation. Each branch can only access its own trader data, authenticated by your Login ID. Manager logins see the same underlying branch data as their team. Trader data is persistently stored in Firebase Firestore, ensuring it's saved across sessions and centrally managed for your branch.",
